Interpreter Proszcza oraz system programowania genetycznego.

1. This was a project written for a course "genetic programming".
2. It contains a fully functional interpeter of a designed language and all the genetic programming stuff: populations, mutations, crossing etc.
3. It works... a bit, more sophisticated genetic algorithm should be needed to generate truly useful programs beyond standard examples.
4. The interpreted language is ugly as sin. Don't look at it, it was meant to be digestible only for genetic algorithms anyway.
5. People, who committed this thing are: Mateusz Strza≈Çkowski (who is to blame for the interpreter) and Konrad Praszkiewicz.
